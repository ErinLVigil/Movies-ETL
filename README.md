# Movies-ETL

## Overview
    The purpose of this project was to utilize ETL methodology to take different data sets, clean the data, and combine the data into tables that could be utilized for analysis in SQL. 
    We used different types of data sources and required techniques for translating and manipulating both structured and unstructred data. This project needed both a strong understanding of technical skills as well as analytical skills to decide the best techniques for each column.
